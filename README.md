## Roadmap

### A new version of Mrya will roll out when the Roadmap is completed and bug checks are finished. A new Roadmap will then be created.
This roadmap outlines the major features planned for the next version of Mrya.

- **Multi-line Comments**: Add support for block comments using `/* ... */` syntax for better documentation.
- **Switch Statement**: Implement a `switch` statement for cleaner handling of multiple conditions.
- **Try/Catch Blocks**: Introduce structured exception handling to allow users to catch and manage runtime errors gracefully.
- **HTTP Module**: ***IMPORTANT: THIS WILL NOT BE MADE ANYTIME SOON (probably- so stay tuned for updates)*** Create a new native module for making HTTP requests to interact with web APIs.
