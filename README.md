# Mrya Programming Language

**Mrya** is a dynamic, object-oriented scripting language with a clean and approachable syntax. It's designed to be easy to learn for beginners while being powerful enough for building applications, from command-line tools to web servers.

## Features

-   **Object-Oriented Programming**: Full support for `class`, inheritance (`<`), and special methods (`_start_`, `_out_`).
-   **Built-in Web Framework**: Create web servers with an elegant decorator-based routing system (`%web.route`).
-   **HTML Templating**: Dynamically render HTML templates with the native `html` package.
-   **Rich Standard Library**: Includes modules for file system operations (`fs`), time, string manipulation, and more.
-   **Modern Syntax**: Features like H-Strings for formatting (`#"Hello <name>!"#`), lists (`[]`), and maps (`{}`).
-   **Robust Error Handling**: Gracefully manage errors with `try`/`catch`/`end` blocks.
-   **First-Class Functions**: Use functions as variables and enhance them with decorators (`%`).

## Documentation

The complete language syntax, features, and a list of all built-in functions are documented in **COMMANDS.md**.

For building web applications, see the **Web Package Guide**.

## Roadmap

This roadmap outlines some of the major features planned for future versions of Mrya.

- **Multi-line Comments**: Add support for block comments using `/* ... */` syntax for better documentation.
- **Switch Statement**: Implement a `switch` statement for cleaner handling of multiple conditions.
- **JSON Module**: A native module for parsing and stringifying JSON data, perfect for web APIs.
- **Package Manager**: A command-line tool to easily install and manage third-party Mrya packages.
